```{r}
biopsy |> 
  ggplot(aes(x = clump_thickness, y=uniform_cell_size)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = outcome)) +
  labs(
    x = "Clump thickness",
    y = "Uniform cell size",
    title = "Clump thickness by cell size"
  )
```

In this graph, we can see that there is a correlation between clump thickness and the state of the cell.

For example, a cell of size 3 has a high probability of being malignant if the clump thickness is higher than 7.
